    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>3 cups sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped spinach</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons diced shallots</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup Arborio rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Chardonnay wine</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a saute pan over medium heat. Add mushrooms and cook for 3 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon butter, spinach, shallots, and 1/2 teaspoon salt; saute until spinach wilts and shallots begin to caramelize, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add rice; cook and stir until rice begins to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add wine and continue stirring until liquid is almost absorbed, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Begin to add broth, 1/2 cup at a time. Stir until broth is almost completely absorbed, then add another 1/2 cup and repeat. Continue adding broth until risotto resembles a thick porridge but still has some bite to it. This process will take 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and add Parmesan cheese, spinach-mushroom mixture, remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Season with salt if needed. Serve immediately.</li>
